    + Added some explanatory text to desync messages.
    + Added an option to the control panel to disable

      IceUI options. One with a more fine-grained
      control of colors. And one with options to control
      other widgets. The last one is empty right now but
      will fill if other widget developers use this
      feature.

    + Little speedups by using local variables.

    * Update speed is no longer dependent on the
      framerate.
    * As a workaround IceUI is no longer drawn after
      pressing F5 because LuaUI isn't hidden as it

      for widescreen resolutions.

    + The ping and CPU usage in the Player Info Window

    * The performance should be slightly better now.
    * The tooltip can show 5 lines now but the font is
      bigger if there are less.
    * The special unit tooltip only shows the unit
      name now as in IceXuicks design. I will completely
      redo it sometime soon though.

  2007-08-13

    + You can click through the console (chat window)
      now.
    * The teams on the Player Info Window are now
      sorted by allies when speccing.

      can middle-click the tooltip to get to the last

      sharing. Now it should work.

      positioning and other stuff still needs some work
      though.
    + The tooltip also shows the storage now on the
      allied resource bars.
    + There's a new tab with player names in the
      Player Info window. This will become useful once
      it can be shown in a second column.
    + Clicking on the allied resource bars now gives
      resources to that player.
    * TeamLogos of specs don't have the enemy overlay
      anymore.
    * Dead players are no longer shown as specs in the
      chat window. Though it's now the other way around
      if Team0 dies. I still need to find a fix for
      that.

      instead of "#3".

  2007-06-26

    + Player Info window now shows all players for
      specs (resources won't be updated for the
      "enemies" though because LuaUI v0.1 doesn't permit
      that)
    + TeamLogos now show a skull if the team is dead

  GAP because of HD crash

  2007-06-05

    * Fixed default positions and sizes
    * Options, Colors, Positions and Sizes are being
      saved now
    * Several new options for the console
      - Hide Build pos blocked messages
